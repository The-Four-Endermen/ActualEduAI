# AiThena AI

**AiThena AI** is a Python-based tool powered by the Gemini 1.5 Pro model from Google. It analyzes Malaysian primary school student assessment data in English and Mathematics, providing performance levels, key strengths and weaknesses, and personalized recommendations for improvement and enrichment.
Features

    1. Validates student assessment data for structure and completeness.
    2. Sends structured prompts to Gemini AI for educational analysis.
    3. Parses Geminiâ€™s response and formats it into structured JSON output.
    4. Logs all major actions and handles errors gracefully.

Notes
  This is only a prototype which we have not finalised the prompt, output and features
  Our next moves:
  
    1. Provide assessments for English and Mathematics for students to answer 
    2. Using those assessments as inputs for AI to:
      2.1 Give learning level analysis
      2.2 Personalised curriculum recomendations based on weaknesses and learning style
      2.3 Teacher dashboard which teachers can monitor students progresses and also suggest effective learning strategies
